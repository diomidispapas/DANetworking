# DANetworking
DECIDE (DEcentralised Control In Distributed sElf-adaptive software) is a rigorous approach to decentralising the control loops of distributed self-adaptive software used in mission-critical applications. DECIDE uses quantitative verification at run time, first to agree individual component contributions to meeting system-level QoS requirements, and then to ensure that components achieve their agreed contributions in the presence of changes and failures.
DANetwork is the networking engine behind DECIDE that allows DECIDE's components to communicate. It is based on the Publisher-Subscriber real-time model.

The project is written is Objectice-C, C and Swift and you can open it XCode 6 or AppCode.
Pod install before running it.
